                                  Loan Prediction

A large portion of a retail bankâ€™s profits come from the interests incurred on home loans.
But this is incumbent upon the timely payments of premiums of the loans by the clients.
If the client defaults on the loan repayment, then the bank incurs a huge loss.
It is thus very important for banks to choose its clients carefully.
This project is about loan prediction to identify creditworthiness of borrowers.
